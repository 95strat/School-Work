After the Hero’s armor was destroyed, an enemy had run up to him to give a killing blow. In an attempt to block with his trusted battle axe, the hero shouted; “Not My Time!” Just before the first blow struck the battle axe, a bright colorful light consumed the battle axe and the hero had seemed to be swept up into the colorful streams of light, away from Battleville. 
	The hero awakes, and he assumes he had just perished and is in the afterlife, as he is adorned with a new streamline set of clothes and weapons he has never seen before, standing in a place which is totally unlike anything he has seen. A gentleman walks by, the hero says, “Excuse me, kind sir, but I think I have lost my way, can you tell me where I am?” The gentleman replied,” Yes, you are on Light Street.”, feeling a bit confused the hero says, “I meant the place what city am I in?” The gentleman replies with a smile, “Battleville, and if you must know, the year is 2016.”
